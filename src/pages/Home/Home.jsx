          Iâ€™m a backend software engineer with a deep love for programming languages. You could say Iâ€™m on a never-ending quest to find the perfect syntaxâ€”or at least the one that sparks the most joy! Whether itâ€™s the memory safety of Rust or the simplicity of Go, Iâ€™m always eager to dive into something new and add another language to my growing collection.

	In this tutorial we will be making a Deep Learning binary classification neural network model using Tensorflow and train it on the Titanic Disaster Dataset from Kaggle Competitions. We will also look at how to connect Google Colab with Kaggle so that you can do things like download Kaggle datasets and Upload Results from the notebook itself." linkText="/blog/titanic-disaster-neural-network-using-tensorflow-and-google-colab-and-uploading-it-to-kaggle"/>

Now would be as good of a time as any to get into developing apps by yourself.

With the increasing number of things we can do from our mobile devices the job market for app developers is growing rapidly and will continue to grow in the foreseeable future. The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has further boomed the market as people are doing more and more things from their homes. Besides, you wouldnâ€™t wanna be depended on someone else when you finally have that billion dollar idea now, would you? ðŸ˜†
