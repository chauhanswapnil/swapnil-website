            I have recently graduated from my Masters in Computer Science program at the Queen Mary University of London. I have been
            programming in a variety of languages since I was in 6th grade. My passion for programming and motivation is fuelled by the
            prospect of making things which would be used by people around the world. <br />
            <br />I worked as a Data Science Project Intern at Teragence Ltd, London to improve their existing na√Øve signal estimator
            algorithms to smart AI/ML- based estimation workflow. I am using technologies like QGIS, Python (Data Analysis libraries like
            Numpy, Pandas, PyTorch, etc), Docker, Kubernetes and ReactJS. <br />
            <br />I previously worked in a startup as a Software Engineer, using technologies like Swift, Python, NodeJS, ReactJS, Git,
            Amazon Web Services, SQL, Firebase and Linux. Some of the projects I worked on are aarjaychairs.com, the Before Visit app, and
            Momma's Kitchen app. Aside from professional work, I am also motivated to work on personal projects. Some of the projects
            include a few iOS Apps that I have published, contributions to Stack Overflow, a portfolio website and a Raspberry PI home NAS
            server that I have deployed. I also constantly participate in a variety of online coding competitions like Google Kickstart,
            Google CodeJam, CodeChef, Hackerrank, Leetcode and HackerEarth to improve my coding and problem-solving skills. My will to work
            hard and my passion for technology will ensure that if given the opportunity, I will exceed all expectations. Looking forward to
            hearing back from you.
